# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. My motivation was to be prepared. I wanted to learn as much as I could so I could become more comfortable with the code and programs that I will be using during thr bootcamp. Building this project allowed me the opportunity to begin learning the flow of using VS code, git, and terminal.
